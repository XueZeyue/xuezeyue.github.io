Hello, Iâ€™m Zeyue Xue, a researcher with a passion for building Generative AI products and platforms. I am also a PhD student at The University of Hong Kong (MMLAB@HKU). Previously, I worked at [Midjourney China](https://www.youchuanai.com/), SenseTime Research, and NUS. One of my recent notable contributions involves [RAPHAEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18295), a large-scale text-to-image generator featured in [SenseMirage](https://miaohua.sensetime.com/). My research interests lie in large-scale deep learning and deep generative models. 

<font color="red">I am actively looking for collaborations on building GenAI products/platforms or conducting research on diffusion models. If you are interested, please feel free to email me.</font>
