Hello, I’m Zeyue Xue (薛泽岳), a researcher with a passion for building Generative AI products and platforms. I am also a PhD student at The University of Hong Kong (MMLAB@HKU). My research interests lie in large-scale deep learning and deep generative models. <font color="red">I am actively looking for collaborations on building multimodal GenAI models. If you are interested, please feel free to email me.</font>
