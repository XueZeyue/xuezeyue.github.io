Hello, I’m Zeyue Xue (薛泽岳), a researcher with a passion for building Generative AI products and platforms. I am also a PhD candidate at The University of Hong Kong (MMLAB@HKU), advised by Ping Luo and Wenping Wang. I received my Bachelor's degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology with a ranking top 1%. 

<font color="red">I am actively looking for a full-time research scientist position in industry starting from 2026. Please reach out if there is a good match.</font>
